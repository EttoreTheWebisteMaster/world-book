## Introduction

"The World's Book" is more than just a website – it’s a creative experiment where every participant can leave their mark on a shared story. The narrative evolves with each contribution, creating a rich tapestry of diverse voices and ideas. This README provides an overview of how the platform works, how to get started, and guidelines for contributing to ensure a positive and collaborative environment for all users.

## How It Works

### Writer's Tokens

Upon registration, each user receives **12 Writer's Tokens**. These tokens are your currency for interacting with the book. Here’s how you can use them:

- **Writing Paragraphs:** Use 1 token to write a paragraph (up to 255 characters).
- **Removing Paragraphs:** Use 3 tokens to remove any paragraph, regardless of who wrote it.
- **Creating New Chapters:** Use 10 tokens to start a new chapter.
- **Buying Tokens:** You can purchase 10 additional tokens if you run out.

### Writing Paragraphs

To add to the story, simply spend 1 token to write a paragraph of up to 255 characters. This allows you to contribute to the ongoing narrative, adding your unique voice to the global story.

### Removing Paragraphs

If you come across a paragraph that you feel disrupts the flow or quality of the story, you can remove it by spending 3 tokens. This feature ensures that the community can maintain the integrity and coherence of the narrative.

### Creating New Chapters

When you feel the story needs a new direction or a fresh start, you can create a new chapter for 10 tokens. This allows for significant shifts in the storyline and opens up new possibilities for the narrative.

### Buying Tokens

If you run out of tokens, you can purchase an additional 10 tokens to continue contributing to the story. This ensures that your creative flow is never interrupted.

## Technologies Used

"The World's Book" leverages modern technologies to provide a seamless and engaging user experience. For the frontend, I used **React** with **Next.js**, which allows me to create a dynamic and responsive interface that enhances your storytelling experience. The platform is hosted on **Vercel**, providing fast and reliable performance. For data storage and management, I use **PostgreSQL**, ensuring that all contributions and user interactions are securely and efficiently handled.

## Getting Started

1. **Register an Account:** Sign up on "The World's Book" to receive your initial 12 Writer's Tokens.
2. **Explore the Story:** Read through the existing chapters and paragraphs to get a sense of the narrative.
3. **Contribute:** Use your tokens to add paragraphs, remove disruptive ones, or start new chapters.
4. **Interact with the Community:** Engage with other writers, provide feedback, and collaborate to shape the story.

## Community Guidelines

To ensure a positive and collaborative environment, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Be Respectful:** Treat other contributors with respect and kindness. Constructive criticism is welcome, but personal attacks are not tolerated.
- **Stay On-Topic:** Ensure your contributions are relevant to the current storyline or chapter. Off-topic paragraphs may be removed by other users.
- **No Plagiarism:** Only submit original content. Plagiarism will result in the removal of the offending content and potential banning from the platform.
- **Avoid Inappropriate Content:** Do not submit content that is offensive, harmful, or violates community standards. Such content will be removed, and the user may be banned.

## Contributing

"The World's Book" thrives on community contributions. Here are ways you can help:

- **Write:** Add paragraphs and chapters to the story.
- **Moderate:** Use your tokens to remove content that doesn’t fit the story.
- **Feedback:** Provide constructive feedback to other writers to help improve the narrative.
